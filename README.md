## Abstract
The mobile phone industry is one of the most innovative and rapidly developing field within Information and communications technology (ICT). Technical change and new product proliferation have made this industry extremely dynamic, even if market shares are highly concentrated in the hands of very few companies. To make profits and improve their competitiveness in the market, these manufacturers keep renewing their design of the mobile phones and launch new versions of smartphones frequently. However, most modern smartphones follow Apple’s iPhone design, which can generally be described as a large screen, a notch, and no headphone jack. In this project, we are going to design a smartphone appearance using deep learning techniques to see if these models can generate some surprisingly creative designs and break the ”traditional” design.

## Contributions
Kyle writes the crawler script that collects smartphone images as raw dataset. Tz-Ruei and Zhilin pre-processes the images; for instance, they replace screens with white rectangles or colorize the smartphone features with different colors. Then, for the experiment, Kyle prepares the inter- face for DCGAN and all three team members run DCGAN over different training sets. For the presentation, Zhilin pre- pares the introduction and the first trial; Kyle prepares the second trial that involves removing the white screen and the third trial that involves transfer learning; Tz-Ruei prepares the fourth trial that involves colorized phones and also con- clusion and future directions. For the paper, each member writes the paper according to what they prepared in the presentation.
